All 129 issues have been analyzed and categorized. Wave 1 (critical and
high-severity fixes) is verified complete with 53 issues resolved. The
remaining 76 medium-priority echoes are ready for Wave 2 processing.

Risk Level: LOW
Status: READY FOR WAVE 2
Recommendation: PROCEED

The development branch is stable, functional, and ready for continued work.
All critical blockers have been cleared. Wave 2 can begin immediately with
an estimated duration of 1-2 days for a team of 1-3 developers.

## CONTEXT / BACKGROUND
What’s going on and why this matters.
- Problem(s):
- Constraints:
- Current state:

## OUTCOMES / SUCCESS CRITERIA (OKRs)
Objectives + measurable Key Results.

## REQUIREMENTS
### Functional
List required tasks states or actions e.g.. "The system **must** … ", "The agent(s) **must** …"

### Non-Functional (Quality Attributes)
List target qualities (e.g., reliability, performance, security, maintainability, portability, usability).

## PLAN / WORK BREAKDOWN / DELIVERABLES
Top-level tasks, milestones, artifacts.

## PROBLEMS • RISKS • ASSUMPTIONS • DEPENDENCIES
List problems, risks, assumptions, dependencies.

## PRIORITIZATION (MoSCoW)

## STATUS & MILESTONES / ROADMAP

## AGENT PROMPT SPECS / POLICIES
Exact prompts/instructions the agents follow.

## IDENTITIES & SECRETS
Service accounts, tokens, least-privilege rules.

## STAKEHOLDERS & RESPONSIBILITIES (RACI / DACI)
Who does the work, who decides, who’s consulted/informed.
(Optionally add DACI for decision records: Driver, Approver, Contributors, Informed.)

## TAXONOMY / LABELS
Repo/runners/issues/workflows labels.

## DOMAINS & BOUNDED CONTEXTS (DDD)
Define domain language and boundaries.

## CONSTRAINTS / SLOs & SLIs
Targets and how you’ll measure them.

## DEPENDENCIES & COUPLINGS
Surface integration points and tight couplings (APIs, rate limits, auth).

## STANDARDS & FRAMEWORKS
What you reference for consistency (architecture, process, goals).

## SCALABILITY & CAPACITY
Concurrency, throughput, storage; runner pool sizing.

## TEAMS / GROUPS
Who owns which areas (labels/runner groups).

## ARCHITECTURE VIEWS (C4 / 4+1)
Link or embed diagrams.

## NOTES
Free-form scratchpad.

## ASSUMPTIONS / HYPOTHESES / PRINCIPLES

## REFERENCES
Docs/links (ADRs, runbooks, APIs).

---
# Optional Expansions (plug-in when needed)

## Architecture & Interfaces
External systems, APIs/CLI (GitHub REST/GraphQL/`gh`), contracts, rate limits.

## Decision Log (ADRs)
One record per significant decision:
- Context → Options → Decision → Consequences
- Links to diagrams, experiments, PRs

## Governance & Change Enablement
How changes are proposed, risk-assessed, approved, scheduled.
- Change types, approval paths, blackout windows, backout plans

## Reliability & Operations
SLIs/SLOs dashboards, alerts, runbooks, incident response.
- Paging policy, severity levels, post-mortem template

## Security & Compliance
Threats, controls, data handling, secrets hygiene, audit trails.

## Data & AI Ops
Prompt/version control, evaluation harnesses, guardrails, audit logs.

## Economics & Resources
Budget envelopes, infra cost targets, headcount constraints.

## Timeline & Releases
Cutovers, backout steps, freeze windows; aligns with Change Enablement.

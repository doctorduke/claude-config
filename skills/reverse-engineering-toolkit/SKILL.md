# Reverse Engineering Toolkit

## Purpose

This skill enables you to understand systems without documentation by analyzing code structure, runtime behavior, dependencies, and design patterns. Use this when facing:

- Undocumented legacy codebases requiring modernization
- Third-party APIs with incomplete specifications
- Lost or outdated design documentation
- Security audits of closed-source systems
- Onboarding to unfamiliar codebases

## When to Use This Skill

**Use reverse engineering when**:
- Documentation is missing, outdated, or incomplete
- System behavior needs to be understood through observation
- Dependencies and coupling need to be visualized
- Design patterns need to be identified and cataloged
- API contracts need to be inferred from implementation
- Legacy code requires understanding before refactoring

**Do NOT use when**:
- Good documentation already exists (read it instead!)
- Source code is unavailable (different techniques needed)
- Simple codebase can be understood by reading
- Time constraints don't allow deep analysis

## Quick Start: 4-Step Process

### 1. Discover
Identify what exists in the system:
```bash
# Find all source files
find . -type f -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.java"

# Count lines of code
cloc .

# Identify entry points
grep -r "main\|app\|server" --include="*.py"
```

### 2. Map
Build a structural understanding:
```python
# Extract imports and dependencies
import ast
with open('module.py') as f:
    tree = ast.parse(f.read())
    imports = [node for node in ast.walk(tree) if isinstance(node, ast.Import)]
```

### 3. Analyze
Understand behavior and patterns:
```bash
# Trace execution
strace -o trace.log ./program

# Analyze function calls
python -m pycallgraph graphviz -- ./script.py
```

### 4. Document
Capture findings:
- Dependency graphs (Mermaid diagrams)
- Design pattern catalog
- API documentation
- Architecture diagrams

## Core Patterns Overview

### Pattern 1: Static Code Analysis
**Purpose**: Understand code structure without execution
**Tools**: tree-sitter, AST parsers, ctags, grep
**Output**: Symbol tables, call graphs, class hierarchies
**See**: PATTERNS.md → Static Code Analysis

### Pattern 2: Dynamic Analysis & Tracing
**Purpose**: Observe runtime behavior and data flow
**Tools**: strace, ltrace, debuggers, profilers
**Output**: Execution traces, memory snapshots, performance profiles
**See**: PATTERNS.md → Dynamic Analysis & Tracing

### Pattern 3: Dependency Graph Extraction
**Purpose**: Map relationships between modules, files, functions
**Tools**: import analyzers, call graph generators, visualization tools
**Output**: Dependency graphs, coupling metrics, circular dependency detection
**See**: PATTERNS.md → Dependency Graph Extraction

### Pattern 4: Design Pattern Recognition
**Purpose**: Identify architectural and code patterns
**Tools**: Pattern matching algorithms, structural analysis
**Output**: Pattern catalog (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)
**See**: PATTERNS.md → Design Pattern Recognition

### Pattern 5: Documentation Generation
**Purpose**: Auto-generate documentation from code analysis
**Tools**: Sphinx, JSDoc, Doxygen, custom generators
**Output**: API docs, architecture diagrams, onboarding guides
**See**: PATTERNS.md → Documentation Generation

## Detailed Resources

- **KNOWLEDGE.md**: Theory, concepts, tools comparison, academic references
- **PATTERNS.md**: Implementation details for all 5 patterns with architecture considerations
- **EXAMPLES.md**: Working code examples for each pattern with real-world use cases
- **GOTCHAS.md**: Common pitfalls, debugging strategies, language-specific challenges
- **REFERENCE.md**: Tool command references, APIs, configuration options

## Top 3 Gotchas

### 1. Obfuscated or Minified Code
**Problem**: Code intentionally made hard to understand
**Solution**: Use deobfuscation tools, focus on runtime behavior instead
**See**: GOTCHAS.md → Obfuscated Code Challenges

### 2. Large Codebase Performance
**Problem**: Analysis tools timeout or consume excessive memory
**Solution**: Incremental analysis, sampling, focus on critical paths
**See**: GOTCHAS.md → Large Codebase Performance Issues

### 3. Dynamic Language Challenges
**Problem**: Type information and call targets unknown until runtime
**Solution**: Combine static analysis with runtime instrumentation
**See**: GOTCHAS.md → Dynamic Language Challenges

### Analysis Approach Selection

| Situation | Approach | Primary Tools |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Need overview | Static analysis | tree-sitter, grep, cloc |
| Understand behavior | Dynamic tracing | strace, debugger |
| Map dependencies | Graph extraction | import analyzers, graphviz |

### Common Commands

```bash
# Quick structure overview
tree -L 3 -I 'node_modules|*.pyc'

# Find entry points
grep -r "if __name__" --include="*.py"
grep -r "function main" --include="*.js"

# Extract function definitions
ctags -R --fields=+n --languages=python .

# Generate call graph
python -m pycallgraph graphviz -- script.py

# Trace system calls
strace -f -e trace=file ./program 2>&1 | grep open

# Dependency analysis (Python)
pydeps module.py --show-deps

# Find design patterns
grep -r "class.*Singleton\|getInstance\|factory" --include="*.py"
```

2. Static Analysis
   ├─ Parse AST for all modules
   ├─ Extract symbols (classes, functions, variables)
   ├─ Build call graph and class hierarchy
   └─ Identify imports and dependencies

3. Dynamic Analysis

   ├─ Trace execution paths
   ├─ Monitor system calls and network traffic
   └─ Profile performance hotspots

4. Pattern Analysis

   ├─ Detect design patterns (Singleton, Factory, etc.)
   ├─ Find architectural patterns (MVC, microservices)
   └─ Catalog anti-patterns and code smells

5. Documentation

## Backcasting Methodology

### Definition
Backcasting is a planning method that starts with defining a desirable future state and works backward to identify policies and programs that will connect the future to the present.

**Origin**: Developed by John Robinson (1982) for energy and environmental planning.

### Backcasting vs Forecasting

| Aspect | Forecasting | Backcasting |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Starting Point | Present state | Desired future state |
| Direction | Forward (what will happen) | Backward (what must happen) |
| Mindset | Predictive, incremental | Normative, transformative |
| Best For | Trend analysis, short-term | Strategic planning, long-term |
| Risk | Missing discontinuities | Infeasible end states |

### When to Use Backcasting

**Ideal Scenarios**:
- The problem is complex with many interdependencies
- Dominant trends are part of the problem (can't extrapolate)
- There's a need for major change (not incremental)
- Time horizon is long enough that prediction is unreliable
- The goal is to meet specific criteria or standards

**Software Engineering Applications**:
- **Architecture Evolution**: Monolith → Microservices
- **Technology Migrations**: Legacy framework → Modern stack
- **Compliance Projects**: Current state → Regulatory compliance
- **Performance Goals**: Slow system → SLA targets
- **Scalability Planning**: Current load → 100x growth target

### The Backcasting Process

```

## Goal Decomposition Theory

### Hierarchical Goal Structures

Goals form natural hierarchies from abstract to concrete:

```
ABSTRACT GOAL: "Improve system reliability"
├─ SUB-GOAL 1: "Reduce error rate"
│  ├─ Task 1.1: Implement retry logic
│  └─ Task 1.2: Add circuit breakers
├─ SUB-GOAL 2: "Increase uptime"
│  ├─ Task 2.1: Add health checks
│  └─ Task 2.2: Implement auto-scaling
└─ SUB-GOAL 3: "Improve observability"
   ├─ Task 3.1: Add distributed tracing
   └─ Task 3.2: Create SLO dashboards
```

### SMART Goal Criteria

End states must be:
- **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous definition
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable success criteria
- **Achievable**: Within technical and resource constraints
- **Relevant**: Aligned with business objectives
- **Time-bound**: Clear deadline or milestone

### Goal Decomposition Strategies

**1. AND Decomposition**: All sub-goals must be achieved
```
Achieve A = Achieve A1 AND Achieve A2 AND Achieve A3
```

**2. OR Decomposition**: Any sub-goal satisfies the parent
```
Achieve B = Achieve B1 OR Achieve B2 OR Achieve B3
```

**3. Sequential Decomposition**: Order matters
```
Achieve C = Achieve C1 THEN Achieve C2 THEN Achieve C3
```

## Backward Chaining Algorithms

### Basic Backward Chaining

Backward chaining is a goal-driven inference method that works backward from the goal to find supporting facts.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def backward_chain(goal, knowledge_base, current_state):
    """
    Recursively work backward from goal to current state.

    Returns: List of prerequisite states (reversed)
    """
    if goal == current_state:
        return [current_state]

    # Find rules that can achieve the goal
    rules = knowledge_base.rules_with_conclusion(goal)

    if not rules:
        return None  # Goal is not achievable

    for rule in rules:
        # Try to prove all prerequisites
        chain = [goal]
        achievable = True

        for prerequisite in rule.prerequisites:
            sub_chain = backward_chain(prerequisite, knowledge_base, current_state)
            if sub_chain is None:
                achievable = False
                break
            chain.extend(sub_chain[:-1])  # Exclude duplicate states

        if achievable:
            return chain

    return None  # No valid path found
```

### State Space Search

Model the problem as a state space:
- **States**: System configurations or situations
- **Actions**: Transitions between states
- **Goal**: Target state
- **Start**: Current state

**Search Strategy**:
```
1. Begin at goal state
2. Generate predecessor states (states that can transition to current)
3. Check if start state is in predecessors
4. If not, recursively expand predecessors
5. Track visited states to avoid cycles
```

### Graph-Based Backward Chaining

```python
class StateGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.states = {}
        self.transitions = {}

    def add_transition(self, from_state, to_state, action, cost=1):
        """Define that action can move from_state to to_state"""
        if from_state not in self.transitions:
            self.transitions[from_state] = []
        self.transitions[from_state].append({
            'to': to_state,
            'action': action,
            'cost': cost
        })

    def backward_search(self, start, goal):
        """Find path from start to goal by searching backward"""
        # Work backward from goal
        queue = [(goal, [goal], 0)]
        visited = {goal}

        while queue:
            current, path, cost = queue.pop(0)

            if current == start:
                return list(reversed(path)), cost

            # Find states that can transition to current
            for state, transitions in self.transitions.items():
                for trans in transitions:
                    if trans['to'] == current and state not in visited:
                        visited.add(state)
                        queue.append((
                            state,
                            path + [state],
                            cost + trans['cost']
                        ))

        return None, float('inf')  # No path found
```

## Means-Ends Analysis

### Overview

Means-Ends Analysis (MEA) is a problem-solving technique that identifies differences between current and goal states, then finds operations (means) to reduce those differences (ends).

**Developed by**: Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon (1972)

### MEA Algorithm

```
1. Compare current state to goal state
2. Identify differences
3. For each difference:
   a. Find an operator that reduces this difference
   b. Check if operator is applicable to current state
   c. If not, create sub-goal to make it applicable
   d. Apply operator
4. Repeat until goal is reached or no operators available
```

### Application to Software Planning

**Example**: Migrate from REST to GraphQL

```
GOAL STATE: All API calls use GraphQL
CURRENT STATE: All API calls use REST

DIFFERENCES:
- Diff 1: Query language (REST vs GraphQL)
- Diff 2: Client libraries (REST client vs GraphQL client)
- Diff 3: Server implementation (REST endpoints vs GraphQL resolvers)

MEANS TO REDUCE DIFFERENCES:
- Operator A: Implement GraphQL server alongside REST
  Prerequisites: GraphQL schema defined, resolvers implemented

- Operator B: Update client to use GraphQL
  Prerequisites: GraphQL server operational, client library installed

- Operator C: Deprecate REST endpoints
  Prerequisites: All clients migrated to GraphQL

BACKWARD CHAIN:
Goal ← Op C ← Op B ← Op A ← Current
```

## Constraint Satisfaction Problems

### Definition

A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) consists of:
- **Variables**: Aspects of the system that can have different values
- **Domains**: Possible values for each variable
- **Constraints**: Restrictions on variable combinations

### Applying CSP to Backcasting

**Variables in Software Planning**:
- Timeline milestones
- Resource allocations
- Technology choices
- Team assignments
- Architecture decisions

**Constraints**:
- **Unary**: Single variable (e.g., "Must use PostgreSQL")
- **Binary**: Two variables (e.g., "If microservices, then Kubernetes")
- **Global**: Multiple variables (e.g., "Total cost < $100k")

### Constraint Propagation

```python
class BackcastingCSP:
    def __init__(self):
        self.variables = {}  # variable -> domain
        self.constraints = []

    def add_constraint(self, constraint_fn, variables):
        """Add a constraint function that takes variable assignments"""
        self.constraints.append((constraint_fn, variables))

    def is_valid_state(self, state_assignment):
        """Check if a state satisfies all constraints"""
        for constraint_fn, variables in self.constraints:
            values = [state_assignment.get(v) for v in variables]
            if not constraint_fn(*values):
                return False
        return True

    def validate_chain(self, state_chain):
        """Validate that all states in chain are feasible"""
        for state in state_chain:
            if not self.is_valid_state(state):
                return False, state
        return True, None
```

**Example Constraints**:
```python
# Timeline constraint
def timeline_valid(start_date, end_date, duration):
    return (end_date - start_date) >= duration

# Resource constraint
def resource_available(team_size, task_complexity):
    return team_size >= task_complexity / 10

# Dependency constraint
def dependency_satisfied(service_A_state, service_B_state):
    if service_B_state == "deployed":
        return service_A_state == "deployed"
    return True
```

## STRIPS Planning

### Overview

STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver) is a classical planning algorithm that uses:
- **States**: Set of predicates that are true
- **Actions**: Operations with preconditions and effects
- **Goal**: Set of predicates that must be true

**Developed by**: Richard Fikes and Nils Nilsson (1971)

### STRIPS Representation

```python
class Action:
    def __init__(self, name, preconditions, add_effects, delete_effects):
        self.name = name
        self.preconditions = set(preconditions)  # Must be true before
        self.add_effects = set(add_effects)      # Become true after
        self.delete_effects = set(delete_effects) # Become false after

    def applicable(self, state):
        """Check if action can be applied in given state"""
        return self.preconditions.issubset(state)

    def apply(self, state):
        """Apply action to state, returning new state"""
        new_state = state.copy()
        new_state.update(self.add_effects)
        new_state.difference_update(self.delete_effects)
        return new_state
```

### Example: Database Migration

```python
# States are sets of predicates
current_state = {
    "mysql_running",
    "data_in_mysql",
    "app_connected_to_mysql"
}

goal_state = {
    "postgres_running",
    "data_in_postgres",
    "app_connected_to_postgres"
}

# Actions
setup_postgres = Action(
    name="setup_postgres",
    preconditions=[],
    add_effects=["postgres_running"],
    delete_effects=[]
)

migrate_data = Action(
    name="migrate_data",
    preconditions=["mysql_running", "postgres_running", "data_in_mysql"],
    add_effects=["data_in_postgres", "data_synchronized"],
    delete_effects=[]
)

switch_connection = Action(
    name="switch_connection",
    preconditions=["data_synchronized", "postgres_running"],
    add_effects=["app_connected_to_postgres"],
    delete_effects=["app_connected_to_mysql"]
)
```

### Backward Search with STRIPS

```python
def strips_backward_search(current, goal, actions):
    """
    Search backward from goal to current state.

    Returns list of actions that transform current to goal.
    """
    if goal.issubset(current):
        return []  # Goal already satisfied

    # Find an unsatisfied goal predicate
    unsatisfied = goal - current
    target_predicate = next(iter(unsatisfied))

    # Find actions that add this predicate
    relevant_actions = [
        a for a in actions
        if target_predicate in a.add_effects
    ]

    for action in relevant_actions:
        # New sub-goal: achieve action's preconditions
        new_goal = (goal - action.add_effects) | action.preconditions

        # Recursively solve sub-goal
        sub_plan = strips_backward_search(current, new_goal, actions)
        if sub_plan is not None:
            return sub_plan + [action]

    return None  # No plan found
```

## Technology Migration Strategies

### Migration Pattern Catalog

#### 1. Strangler Fig Pattern
Gradually replace parts of legacy system with new implementation.

```
Phase 1: Route some requests to new system
Phase 2: Incrementally migrate functionality
Phase 3: Decommission legacy when empty
```

**Backward Chain**:
```
Goal: Legacy decommissioned
├─ Prerequisite: All traffic to new system
│  ├─ Prerequisite: All features in new system
│  │  ├─ Prerequisite: Feature parity validated
│  │  └─ Prerequisite: Performance validated
│  └─ Prerequisite: Routing logic in place
└─ Current: All traffic to legacy
```

#### 2. Parallel Run Pattern
Run old and new systems simultaneously, compare outputs.

```
Phase 1: Deploy new system alongside old
Phase 2: Duplicate traffic to both systems
Phase 3: Compare results, fix discrepancies
Phase 4: Switch to new system
Phase 5: Decommission old system
```

#### 3. Blue-Green Deployment
Maintain two production environments, switch atomically.

```
Blue (Current): Production traffic
Green (Target): New version, idle

Migration: Switch traffic from Blue to Green
Rollback: Switch traffic back to Blue
```

#### 4. Database Migration Strategies

**Pattern A: Dual-Write Migration**
```
Goal: All data in DB_NEW, all reads from DB_NEW
├─ Phase 4: Stop writing to DB_OLD
│  ├─ Phase 3: All reads from DB_NEW
│  │  ├─ Phase 2: Verify data parity
│  │  │  ├─ Phase 1: Dual-write to both DBs
│  │  │  │  ├─ Phase 0: DB_NEW schema ready
│  │  │  │  └─ Current: Only DB_OLD
```

**Pattern B: ETL Migration**
```
Goal: DB_OLD decommissioned
├─ Validate data in DB_NEW
│  ├─ Run ETL pipeline
│  │  ├─ Design ETL transformations
│  │  │  ├─ Map DB_OLD schema to DB_NEW
│  │  │  └─ Current: Only DB_OLD
```

### Framework Upgrade Strategies

#### Major Version Upgrade (e.g., React 16 → 18)

```
Goal: React 18, all tests passing, production stable
├─ Phase N: Deploy to production
│  ├─ Phase N-1: Integration tests passing
│  │  ├─ Phase N-2: Fix breaking changes
│  │  │  ├─ Phase N-3: Update dependencies
│  │  │  │  ├─ Phase N-4: Review migration guide
│  │  │  │  └─ Current: React 16
```

**Critical Prerequisites**:
- All dependencies compatible with new version
- Breaking changes documented and addressed
- Deprecation warnings resolved
- Test suite comprehensive enough to catch regressions

## Key Takeaways

1. **Backcasting is normative, not predictive**: It defines a desirable future and works backward, rather than extrapolating current trends.

2. **Backward chaining finds prerequisites**: Each state transition has preconditions that must be satisfied.

3. **Constraints validate feasibility**: CSP techniques ensure plans are achievable within real-world constraints.

4. **STRIPS formalizes planning**: Representing actions as preconditions + effects enables automated plan generation.

5. **Migration patterns are proven**: Strangler Fig, Blue-Green, and Dual-Write are battle-tested approaches.

6. **Goal decomposition creates structure**: Breaking abstract goals into concrete tasks makes planning tractable.

# Gap Analysis Framework

## Purpose

"What's missing?" - This Skill identifies deficiencies across all aspects of software systems:

1. **Requirements vs Implementation** - Missing features or incomplete implementations
2. **Test Coverage Gaps** - Untested code paths and scenarios
3. **Documentation Gaps** - Missing or outdated documentation
4. **Security Posture Gaps** - Vulnerabilities and missing security controls
5. **Performance Gaps** - Performance below targets or benchmarks
6. **Feature Parity** - Comparing with competitors or specifications
7. **Team/Skill Gaps** - Missing expertise or resources
8. **Infrastructure Gaps** - Missing monitoring, redundancy, or scaling
9. **Compliance Gaps** - Regulatory and standards non-compliance
10. **Accessibility Gaps** - WCAG, ARIA, and inclusive design deficiencies

## When to Use This Skill

Use gap analysis for:
- Pre-launch readiness assessment
- Migration planning and competitive analysis
- Compliance audits and security assessments
- Test strategy planning and documentation reviews
- Team planning and infrastructure reviews
- Accessibility audits and API versioning
- Dependency audits and coverage analysis

## Quick Start

### 1. Define Your Gap Type

Choose the analysis pattern matching your use case:

| Gap Type | Use Case | Tools |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Requirements** | Missing features or implementations | Code inspection, requirements tracking |
| **Test Coverage** | Untested code paths | Coverage.py, Jest, Istanbul |
| **Documentation** | Missing or outdated docs | Docstring analysis, README review |
| **SWOT** | Strategic capability assessment | Stakeholder interviews, market analysis |
| **Maturity Model** | Organizational capability level | CMM assessment, process audit |
| **Security Posture** | Security controls and compliance | SAST/DAST, vulnerability scanning |

### 2. Analyze Current vs Target State

```
Target State (What should be)
         ↓
    ┌────────┐
    │  GAP   │  = Missing, incomplete, deficient
    │Analysis│
    └────────┘
         ↑
Current State (What is)
```

### 3. Prioritize Gaps

```
         │ Easy to Fix │ Hard to Fix │
─────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
High     │   QUICK     │  STRATEGIC  │
Impact   │    WINS     │   GAPS      │
─────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
Low      │  OPTIONAL   │   IGNORE    │
Impact   │IMPROVEMENTS │   FOR NOW   │
─────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### 4. Create Action Plan

For each gap:
1. **Assign Owner** - Who fixes this?
2. **Set Timeline** - By when?
3. **Allocate Resources** - What budget/people?
4. **Define Success** - How to measure closure?
5. **Track Progress** - Regular reviews

## Core Concepts

### Gap Analysis Process

1. **Define Target State** - Requirements, standards, best practices
2. **Assess Current State** - Inventory, measure, document capabilities
3. **Identify Gaps** - Compare target vs current, quantify
4. **Prioritize** - Impact/effort matrix, dependencies
5. **Plan Actions** - Assign owners, set timelines, allocate resources
6. **Execute & Monitor** - Regular reviews, adjust as needed
7. **Verify Closure** - Confirm gap resolution

### Maturity Model Levels

Organizational capability evolves across levels:

```
Level 5: OPTIMIZING    │ ████████████ │ Continuous improvement
Level 4: MANAGED       │ █████████░░░ │ Measured and controlled
Level 3: DEFINED       │ ██████░░░░░░ │ Documented processes
Level 2: REPEATABLE    │ ███░░░░░░░░░ │ Basic discipline
Level 1: INITIAL       │ █░░░░░░░░░░░ │ Ad-hoc/chaotic
```

Maturity gaps show the distance between current and target capability levels.

### SWOT Framework

Gap analysis often uses SWOT to identify strategic gaps:

```
┌────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┐
│ STRENGTHS              │ WEAKNESSES (GAP)       │
│ ✓ What we do well      │ ✗ What's missing      │
├────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┤
│ OPPORTUNITIES          │ THREATS (RISK GAP)    │
│ ⚡ Market potential    │ ⚠️  Gaps expose risk   │
└────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘
```

## Implementation Patterns

See **PATTERNS.md** for detailed analysis patterns:
1. Requirements vs Implementation
2. Test Coverage
3. Documentation
4. SWOT Analysis
5. Capability Maturity Model (CMM)
6. Security Posture

## Common Gap Analysis Mistakes

See **GOTCHAS.md** for:
- Analysis paralysis and scope creep
- Ignoring root causes and constraints
- Missing stakeholder input
- No prioritization or metrics
- One-time snapshots instead of continuous monitoring

## Best Practices

**DO's**:
- Define clear target state before analyzing
- Quantify gaps with metrics, not just qualitative assessment
- Prioritize ruthlessly - focus on critical gaps first
- Involve stakeholders - get customer, user, and operator input
- Automate detection - build scripts for continuous monitoring
- Track over time - gap analysis should be ongoing
- Root cause analysis - understand *why* gaps exist
- Create action plans - assign owners and timelines
- Celebrate progress - acknowledge closed gaps
- Use industry benchmarks - compare against standards

**DON'Ts**:
- Compare to perfection - set realistic, achievable targets
- Analyze without acting - analysis without action is waste
- Ignore constraints - consider resources, time, budget
- Blame individuals - focus on systems and processes
- Scope creep - distinguish gaps from new features
- Forget context - startup needs differ from enterprise
- Skip quick wins - balance long-term and immediate actions
- Ignore stakeholders - technical gaps aren't the only ones
- Set and forget - reassess regularly as targets evolve
- Overwhelm teams - pace remediation to avoid burnout

## Example: Quick Requirements Gap Analysis

**Scenario**: E-commerce site launch in 2 weeks, need to verify completeness.

**1. Identify Requirements**:
```
REQ-001: User registration with email
REQ-002: Product catalog with search
REQ-003: Shopping cart with checkout
REQ-004: Order history and receipts
REQ-005: Admin dashboard for inventory
```

**2. Assess Implementation**:
- REQ-001: 100% complete (with tests)
- REQ-002: 80% complete (search not optimized)
- REQ-003: 50% complete (cart works, checkout needs payment integration)
- REQ-004: 0% (missing)
- REQ-005: 20% (basic scaffolding only)

**3. Identify Gaps**:
```
│ Requirement        │ Status      │ Coverage │ Impact   │
├────────────────────┼─────────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
│ REQ-001            │ Complete    │ 100%     │ None     │
│ REQ-002            │ Partial     │ 80%      │ Medium   │
│ REQ-003            │ Partial     │ 50%      │ CRITICAL │
│ REQ-004            │ Missing     │ 0%       │ CRITICAL │
│ REQ-005            │ Partial     │ 20%      │ High     │
```

**4. Prioritize**:
- CRITICAL: Complete checkout (hard, essential) + Order history (medium effort)
- HIGH: Admin dashboard improvements (ongoing)
- MEDIUM: Search optimization (post-launch nice-to-have)

**5. Plan Actions**:
- Assign payment integration to Backend Lead (3 days)
- Assign order history to Full-stack Dev (2 days)
- Assign dashboard to Admin Dev (5 days, starts after launch)

**6. Monitor**:
- Daily standup on critical gaps
- Verify acceptance criteria met
- Launch when critical gaps closed

This 6-step process provides clear visibility on what's missing and what needs immediate attention.

  Owner: QA + All devs
  Task: End-to-end flow testing (register → purchase → confirmation → history)

QUICK WIN (Low effort, high impact):
Day 1-2: Admin dashboard (partial)
  Owner: Backend dev (parallel to payment work)
  Task: Basic views (inventory, orders, reporting)
  Accept: Won't be perfect, iterate post-launch

OPTIONAL (If time permits):
Day 5: Notification emails beyond confirmation
  Owner: Backend lead
  Task: Order status updates

LAUNCH CRITERIA:
✓ Payment processing working with error handling
✓ Order confirmation emails sending
✓ Order history visible to users

5. Why? → Never tracked relationship between coverage and bugs

ROOT CAUSES:
- Missing: Testing culture and standards
- Missing: Data on test ROI
- Missing: Testing infrastructure and tools
- Missing: Test-first development practices
- Missing: Clear accountability for coverage

INSIGHTS:

- Kubernetes platform for service orchestration
- Full observability
- 80%+ test coverage
- API-first architecture

Actions:
- Migrate services to Kubernetes
- Complete monitoring/alerting/logging
- Scale testing to all services
- Cost: $200K (platform engineering, infra)

PHASE 4: Legacy Phase-Out (Months 31-42)
Goals:
- Migrate remaining monolith to microservices
- Sunset legacy code
- Full security compliance
- 100x scalability achieved

Actions:
- Extract remaining monolith functions
- API gateway replacement
- Legacy code decommissioning
- Cost: $100K (final migrations)

TOTAL: 3.5 years, $750K
```

### Outcome

```
Before (Year 1):
- Monolith: 500K lines, hard to change
- Deployment: 30 minutes, risky
- Test coverage: 20%
- Scalability: 1K users max
- Availability: 95%
- Team: 15 developers, slow delivery

After (Year 4):
- Microservices: 12 services, independently deployable
- Deployment: 5 minutes per service, confident
- Test coverage: 80%+
- Scalability: 100K+ users
- Availability: 99.95% (high reliability)
- Team: 15 developers, 3x faster delivery
- New capabilities: AI/ML features, real-time analytics

Key Metrics:
- Deployment frequency: 1x/month → 10x/day
- Lead time for changes: 3 weeks → 1 day
- MTTR (incident recovery): 4 hours → 15 minutes
- Bug escape rate: 30% → 5%
- Team velocity: 40 points/sprint → 100 points/sprint
```

## Learning from Examples

These examples demonstrate:

1. **Comprehensive Gap Analysis**: Multiple dimensions (code, infra, org, skills)
2. **Prioritization**: Critical path first, nice-to-haves deferred
3. **Realistic Planning**: Months/years for transformations
4. **Resource Allocation**: Money, people, time
5. **Monitoring**: Track progress, adjust plans
6. **Business Impact**: Connect technical gaps to business outcomes
7. **Continuous Improvement**: Not one-time event, but ongoing

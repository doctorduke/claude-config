## Orchestration vs Choreography

### Orchestration

**Characteristics:**
- Central coordinator controls flow
- Explicit workflow definition
- Clear visibility of process
- Easier to modify and version

**Use When:**
- Complex business logic
- Need centralized monitoring
- Clear boundaries and ownership

### Choreography

**Characteristics:**
- No central coordinator
- Services react to events
- Loose coupling
- More resilient to failures

**Use When:**
- Simple workflows
- High scalability requirements
- Services owned by different teams

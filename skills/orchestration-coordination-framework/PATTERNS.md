# Orchestration Patterns

Implementation patterns for orchestrating AI agents. Each pattern addresses specific use cases.

## Pattern Selection Guide

| Pattern | Use Case | Complexity | Scalability |
|---------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Multi-Agent Task Decomposition** | Complex objectives, specialized agents | Medium | High |
| **Airflow DAG** | Scheduled batch jobs, data pipelines | Medium | High |
| **Temporal Workflow** | Long-running, mission-critical | High | Very High |
| **Event-Driven** | Loose coupling, async communication | Medium | Very High |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Fault tolerance, cascading failures | Low | N/A |
| **Resource Pool** | Load balancing, resource management | Medium | High |
| **Distributed Tracing** | Observability, debugging | Low | N/A |

## Pattern 1: Multi-Agent Task Decomposition

### When to Use
- Complex objectives requiring specialized skills
- Tasks with clear dependencies
- Need parallel execution where possible
- Multiple agent types available

### How It Works
1. Decompose objective into subtasks
2. Identify dependencies between tasks
3. Assign tasks to appropriate agent types
4. Execute with dependency resolution
5. Aggregate results

### Key Components
- TaskDecomposer: Breaks objectives into tasks
- Orchestrator: Manages execution flow
- Agent: Executes specific task types
- Dependency Resolver: Ensures correct order

See [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md#pattern-1) for complete implementation.

## Pattern 2: Airflow DAG Coordination

### When to Use
- Scheduled batch operations
- Data pipeline orchestration
- Need rich UI for monitoring
- Python-based workflows

### How It Works
1. Define DAG with tasks and dependencies
2. Schedule DAG execution
3. Tasks execute when dependencies met
4. XCom for inter-task communication
5. Monitor via Airflow UI

### Key Components
- DAG: Workflow definition
- Operators: Task implementations (PythonOperator, BashOperator)
- XCom: Cross-communication between tasks
- Scheduler: Triggers DAG runs

See [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md#pattern-2) for complete implementation.

## Pattern 3: Temporal Durable Execution

### When to Use
- Long-running workflows (hours/days/months)
- Mission-critical processes
- Need automatic retries
- Workflows that must survive crashes

### How It Works
1. Define workflow as code
2. Implement activities (actual work)
3. Temporal manages execution state
4. Automatic retries on failures
5. Workflow survives worker crashes

### Key Components
- Workflow: Orchestration logic
- Activity: Actual work units
- Worker: Executes workflows/activities
- Temporal Server: State management

See [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md#pattern-3) for complete implementation.

## Pattern 4: Event-Driven Coordination

### When to Use
- Loosely coupled services
- Async communication
- Event broadcasting to multiple consumers
- Reactive architectures

### How It Works
1. Agents subscribe to event types
2. Orchestrator publishes events
3. Agents react to relevant events
4. No direct coupling between agents
5. Scalable, resilient communication

### Key Components
- EventBus: Message broker (Redis, Kafka)
- Event: Data + metadata
- Publisher: Emits events
- Subscriber: Handles events

See [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md#pattern-4) for complete implementation.

## Pattern 5: Circuit Breaker

### When to Use
- Calling unreliable external services
- Need fault tolerance
- Prevent cascading failures
- Fail fast when downstream issues

### How It Works
1. Monitor call success/failure rate
2. Open circuit after threshold failures
3. Reject requests while open
4. Periodically test recovery (half-open)
5. Close circuit when recovered

### Key Components
- CircuitBreaker: State machine (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN)
- Failure threshold: When to open
- Timeout: When to attempt recovery
- Success threshold: When to close

See [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md#pattern-5) for complete implementation.

## Pattern 6: Resource Pool with Load Balancing

### When to Use
- Multiple agents/workers available
- Need efficient resource utilization
- Load distribution across agents
- Queue management

### How It Works
1. Register agents in resource pool
2. Submit tasks to pool
3. Pool selects agent via strategy
4. Track agent load and metrics
5. Queue tasks when agents busy

### Key Components
- ResourcePool: Manages agents
- LoadBalancingStrategy: Selection algorithm
- AgentResource: Worker with capacity
- Task Queue: Pending work

### Strategies
- Round Robin: Equal distribution
- Least Loaded: Minimize wait time
- Least Response Time: Fastest first
- Random: Simple distribution

See [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md#pattern-6) for complete implementation.

## Pattern 7: Distributed Tracing

### When to Use
- Debugging distributed systems
- Performance analysis
- Understanding execution flow
- Production monitoring

### How It Works
1. Start trace for request
2. Create spans for operations
3. Propagate trace context
4. Log events and tags
5. Visualize trace tree

### Key Components
- Tracer: Manages traces
- Span: Operation within trace
- Context: Trace ID + parent span
- Tags: Metadata
- Logs: Events within span

See [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md#pattern-7) for complete implementation.

## Combining Patterns

Patterns can be combined for robust systems:

**Example: Production ML Pipeline**
- Airflow DAG: Overall workflow orchestration
- Circuit Breaker: Protect ML model API calls
- Resource Pool: Distribute training jobs
- Distributed Tracing: Monitor entire pipeline
- Event-Driven: Notify downstream systems

## Pattern Anti-Patterns

### Don't:
1. Use DAGs for real-time workflows (use event-driven)
2. Use Temporal for simple task queues (use Celery)
3. Skip circuit breakers for external calls
4. Ignore distributed tracing in production
5. Use single orchestration pattern everywhere

### Do:
1. Match pattern to use case
2. Start simple, add complexity as needed
3. Combine patterns strategically
4. Monitor and measure effectiveness
5. Document pattern choices

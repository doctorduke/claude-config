# Multi-Agent Coordination Framework

## Purpose

Managing multiple AI agents or human teams requires sophisticated coordination mechanisms. This Skill provides comprehensive capabilities for:

1. **Multi-Agent System Architectures** - Hub-spoke, peer-to-peer, hierarchical coordination
2. **Agent Communication Patterns** - Pub/sub, message queues, direct messaging, broadcast
3. **Task Distribution Algorithms** - Load balancing, capability-based routing, priority queues
4. **Consensus and Voting Mechanisms** - Agreement protocols, quorum-based decisions
5. **Conflict Resolution** - Handling disagreements, resource contention, priority conflicts
6. **Agent Specialization and Routing** - Role-based agents, skill matching, dynamic routing
7. **Collaborative Problem-Solving** - Multi-agent reasoning, distributed search, collective intelligence
8. **Shared State Management** - Distributed state, CRDTs, event sourcing
9. **Agent Lifecycle Management** - Registration, health checks, scaling, retirement
10. **Multi-Agent Debugging and Observability** - Distributed tracing, agent metrics, visualization

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Build multi-agent AI systems with specialized agents
- Coordinate human teams with AI assistance
- Implement distributed problem-solving requiring multiple perspectives
- Design complex workflows requiring agent collaboration
- Create agent swarms for parallel processing
- Implement human-in-the-loop AI systems
- Orchestrate multi-model systems (GPT-4, Claude, local models)
- Build competitive agent systems (agents voting/competing)
- Design hierarchical agent organizations
- Create agent mesh networks for resilience
- Implement collaborative code review by multiple agents
- Build ensemble AI systems for improved accuracy

## Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your Architecture

Start by selecting the right architecture for your use case:

- **Hub-Spoke (Centralized)** - Simple coordinator routes tasks to specialized agents
  - Use when: Single point of coordination is acceptable, simple debugging needed
  - Example: Supervisor agent coordinating code review by specialized agents

- **Peer-to-Peer (Distributed)** - Agents communicate directly without central coordinator
  - Use when: High availability needed, no single point of failure tolerated
  - Example: Agent mesh for distributed data processing

- **Hierarchical (Tree)** - Multi-level supervision with delegation
  - Use when: Complex workflows, need clear responsibility hierarchy
  - Example: Engineering organization simulation with managers and workers

- **Mesh (Fully Connected)** - All agents can communicate with all others
  - Use when: Maximum resilience required, communication overhead acceptable
  - Example: Consensus-based decision systems

See [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md#architectures) for detailed architecture diagrams.

### 2. Select Your Framework

Choose the framework that matches your needs:

| Framework | Best For | Complexity | Key Strength |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **LangGraph** | Complex workflows, state management | Medium | Graph-based coordination |
| **AutoGen** | Conversations, human-in-loop | Low | Easy multi-agent chat |
| **CrewAI** | Role-based teams | Low | Task delegation |
| **Custom** | Full control, unique requirements | High | Maximum flexibility |

See [KNOWLEDGE.md](./KNOWLEDGE.md#framework-comparison) for detailed comparison.

### 3. Implement Your First Multi-Agent System

**Example: Simple supervisor pattern with LangGraph**

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
import operator

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]
    next_agent: str

# Create specialized agents
def researcher(state):
    # Research logic
    return {"messages": ["Research complete"], "next_agent": "writer"}

def writer(state):
    # Writing logic
    return {"messages": ["Report written"], "next_agent": "FINISH"}

# Build graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("researcher", researcher)
workflow.add_node("writer", writer)
workflow.add_edge("researcher", "writer")
workflow.add_edge("writer", END)
workflow.set_entry_point("researcher")

app = workflow.compile()
result = app.invoke({"messages": [], "next_agent": "researcher"})
```

See [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md) for complete working examples.

### 4. Add Consensus Mechanism (Optional)

For critical decisions, implement voting:

```python
from multi_agent_coordination import ConsensusEngine, Vote, VoteType

consensus = ConsensusEngine(agents=["agent_1", "agent_2", "agent_3"])

votes = [
    Vote("agent_1", VoteType.YES, 0.9, "High confidence"),
    Vote("agent_2", VoteType.YES, 0.8, "Agree"),
    Vote("agent_3", VoteType.NO, 0.7, "Concerns exist"),
]

result = consensus.simple_majority(votes)
# Returns: {"result": "PASS", "yes": 2, "no": 1, "percentage": 66.7}
```

See [PATTERNS.md](./PATTERNS.md#pattern-4-consensus-voting) for full consensus patterns.

## Top Gotchas

### 1. Coordination Overhead
**Problem**: Too much agent communication slows everything down
**Solution**: Batch communications, use async patterns, minimize chatter
**Detection**: Monitor message count and latency between agents

### 2. Agent Deadlock
**Problem**: Agents waiting for each other in circular dependency
**Solution**: Timeout on all waits, detect cycles, use coordinator to break deadlocks
**Detection**: Trace agent state transitions, look for circular waits

### 3. State Inconsistency
**Problem**: Agents have different views of shared state
**Solution**: Event sourcing, CRDTs, eventual consistency, versioning
**Detection**: Compare agent state snapshots, look for divergence

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous (Request-Response)
Direct agent-to-agent communication with immediate response.
```
Agent A ──request──► Agent B
Agent A ◄─response── Agent B
```

### Asynchronous (Message Queue)
Fire-and-forget messaging via queue.
```
Agent A ──msg──► Queue ──msg──► Agent B
```

### Pub/Sub (Broadcast)
One-to-many broadcasting to subscribers.
```
Publisher ──event──► Topic ──┬──► Subscriber 1
                             ├──► Subscriber 2
                             └──► Subscriber 3
```

See [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md#communication-patterns) for detailed patterns.

## Best Practices

### DO's

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with single agent, add multi-agent only when needed
2. **Clear Contracts** - Define explicit communication protocols between agents
3. **Timeout Everything** - All agent interactions should have timeouts
4. **Monitor Conversations** - Log all agent-to-agent communications
5. **Use Voting** - For critical decisions, use consensus mechanisms
6. **Specialize Agents** - Each agent should have clear, focused responsibility
7. **Handle Failures** - Expect agents to fail, implement graceful degradation
8. **Version Protocols** - Use versioned message formats for compatibility
9. **Test in Isolation** - Test each agent independently before integration
10. **Implement Observability** - Trace multi-agent interactions for debugging

### DON'Ts

1. **Don't Create Agent Explosion** - Resist urge to create too many agents
2. **Don't Share Mutable State** - Use message passing, not shared memory
3. **Don't Ignore Deadlocks** - Test for circular dependencies
4. **Don't Skip Health Checks** - Monitor agent health continuously
5. **Don't Hardcode Routing** - Use dynamic agent discovery and routing
6. **Don't Trust All Agents** - Validate agent responses, especially in open systems
7. **Don't Forget Cleanup** - Properly shutdown and cleanup agent resources
8. **Don't Over-Engineer** - Simple coordination often beats complex protocols

## Agent Communication Languages

### FIPA ACL (Agent Communication Language)

**Overview**: Standard language for agent communication from Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents.

**Key Concepts**:

- **Interaction Protocols**: Contract net, auction, negotiation

**Common Performatives**:
- `inform`: Assert information
- `request`: Request action
- `query-if`: Ask if proposition is true
- `propose`: Make proposal
- `accept-proposal`: Accept a proposal
- `reject-proposal`: Reject a proposal
- `subscribe`: Subscribe to information

**Resources**:
- [FIPA ACL Specifications](http://www.fipa.org/repository/aclspecs.html)

## Distributed Systems Patterns

### Consensus Algorithms

**Raft Consensus**:

- Log replication for consistency
- Safety guarantees
- Use for: Coordinating agent state, leader selection

**Resources**: [Raft Consensus](https://raft.github.io/)

### Event Sourcing

**Overview**: Store state as sequence of immutable events.

**Benefits**:

- Time-travel debugging
- Event-driven architecture

**Pattern**:
```
Events:
1. AgentRegistered(agent_id="A", timestamp=T1)
2. TaskAssigned(agent_id="A", task_id="T1", timestamp=T2)
3. TaskCompleted(agent_id="A", task_id="T1", timestamp=T3)

Current State = Replay(Events 1-3)
```

### Two-Phase Commit

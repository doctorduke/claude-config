## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Detecting Performance Regression

**Situation**: Team merged code that appeared small but introduced performance regression

**Evaluation Process**:
1. Run automated performance benchmark against baseline
2. Detect p95 latency increased from 200ms to 280ms (+40%)
3. Statistical significance confirmed (p < 0.001)
4. Identify root cause: unoptimized database query in new feature
5. Generate report showing regression with red status
6. Developer reverts feature, optimizes query, re-submits
7. New p95: 210ms (acceptable, +5% regression within tolerance)

**Report Output**: Performance regression report served as objective evidence, prevented bad merge

## Evaluation Framework Theory

### Core Evaluation Layers

The evaluation framework operates in five key layers:

1. **Define Metrics & Criteria**
   - Quantitative (numbers, percentages)
   - Qualitative (ratings, categories)
   - Thresholds (pass/fail, acceptable)
   - Benchmarks (industry, historical)

2. **Collect Data**
   - Automated (tools, logs, metrics)
   - Manual (surveys, reviews, audits)
   - Observational (behavior, patterns)
   - Historical (trends, baselines)

3. **Analyze & Score**
   - Aggregate metrics
   - Apply scoring model
   - Normalize across dimensions
   - Calculate composite scores

4. **Interpret & Contextualize**
   - Compare to benchmarks
   - Identify trends
   - Find anomalies
   - Provide insights

5. **Report & Communicate**
   - Executive summary (high-level)
   - Detailed findings (technical)
   - Visualizations (charts, graphs)
   - Recommendations (action items)
   - Format for audience

### Principles of Good Evaluation

- **Objectivity**: Use measurable criteria, minimize bias
- **Consistency**: Apply same standards across subjects
- **Relevance**: Measure what matters to stakeholders
- **Actionability**: Every metric informs a decision
- **Timeliness**: Collect and report in useful timeframes
- **Transparency**: Document methodology and assumptions

## Scoring Systems

### Numeric Scale (0-100)

Standard numeric scoring for universal compatibility:

```
90-100: Excellent
80-89:  Good
70-79:  Acceptable
60-69:  Needs Improvement
0-59:   Unacceptable
```

### Letter Grades (A-F)

Academic-style grading for familiarity:

```
A: 90-100 (Outstanding)
B: 80-89  (Good)
C: 70-79  (Satisfactory)
D: 60-69  (Poor)
F: 0-59   (Failing)
```

### RAG Status (Red/Amber/Green)

Traffic light status for at-a-glance understanding:

```
Green: Meets/exceeds target
Amber: Below target, needs action
Red:   Critical, immediate action
```

### Confidence Levels

Express certainty in measurements:

```
High:   >90% confidence
Medium: 70-90% confidence
Low:    <70% confidence
```

### Weighted Composite Score

Combine multiple dimensions with priorities:

```
Score = Σ(metric × weight)
where Σweights = 1.0

Example:
Code Quality: 85 × 0.30 = 25.5
Performance:  70 × 0.25 = 17.5
Security:     95 × 0.25 = 23.75
Testing:      80 × 0.20 = 16.0
Total:                   = 82.75/100
```

## Metrics Frameworks

### DORA Metrics (DevOps Performance)

Four key metrics measuring software delivery:

- **Deployment Frequency**: How often you deploy to production
- **Lead Time for Changes**: Time from commit to production
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Time to restore service after incident
- **Change Failure Rate**: % of deployments causing failures

**Interpretation**: Higher deployment frequency + lower lead time + high recovery speed = mature DevOps practices

### SPACE Framework (Developer Productivity)

Five dimensions of developer productivity:

- **Satisfaction & Well-being**: Developer happiness, burnout, work-life balance
- **Performance**: Outcomes delivered, business impact
- **Activity**: Volume of work (code commits, lines changed)
- **Communication & Collaboration**: Team interaction quality, knowledge sharing
- **Efficiency & Flow**: Ability to work without interruption, context switching

**Interpretation**: Don't use Activity alone—combine with Satisfaction and Performance for holistic view

### Code Quality Metrics

Standard code quality assessment dimensions:

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Code complexity measure (lower is better)
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: Effort to fix issues vs build new features
- **Code Coverage**: % of code executed by tests
- **Code Duplication**: % of duplicated code blocks
- **Maintainability Index**: Composite metric 0-100 (higher is better)

**Thresholds**:
- Complexity: Average cyclomatic complexity < 5 is excellent
- Coverage: 80%+ is good, 90%+ is excellent
- Duplication: <5% is excellent, <10% is acceptable
- Maintainability: >85 is excellent, >75 is acceptable

### Security Evaluation

Security assessment frameworks:

- **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**: Industry standard for vulnerability severity
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Configuration best practices for infrastructure
- **NIST SSDF**: Secure Software Development Framework
- **OWASP Risk Rating**: Risk assessment methodology

## Visualization Best Practices

### Chart Selection

**Line Charts**:
- Time series data
- Trends over time
- Multiple metrics comparison
- Better than bar charts for large datasets

**Bar Charts**:
- Category comparison
- Discrete values
- Small dataset comparison
- Easier to read exact values

**Heatmaps**:
- Multi-dimensional data
- Patterns across dimensions
- Identifying hotspots
- Good for matrix data

**Box Plots**:
- Distribution visualization
- Percentile information (p25, p50, p75, p95, p99)
- Outlier detection
- Performance variability

**Histograms**:
- Distribution shape
- Frequency analysis
- Finding patterns in data spread

### Color Usage

- **Green**: Success, go, acceptable
- **Yellow/Amber**: Warning, proceed with caution
- **Red**: Failure, stop, critical
- **Blue**: Neutral information
- **Gray**: Disabled, not applicable

### Typography

- **Title**: Large, bold, clear main message
- **Labels**: Readable, descriptive, units included
- **Legend**: Easy to find, colorblind-safe colors
- **Axis**: Clear scale with appropriate intervals

### Principles

1. **Data-to-ink ratio**: Minimize decorative elements
2. **Clarity first**: Prioritize understanding over beauty
3. **Consistency**: Use same styles across all visualizations
4. **Accessibility**: Colorblind-safe, sufficient contrast
5. **Context**: Include baselines, benchmarks, targets

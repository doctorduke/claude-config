# CLAUDE.md — BRIEF-first rules

## Orientation
1) Always open the **nearest `BRIEF.md`** (current dir or parent).
2) Read sections in this order: **Interface Contract → Spec Snapshot → Answer Pack**.
3) For details, only follow links in **Local Reference Index**; do not roam the tree.

## Editing Discipline
- If a BRIEF section is missing/stale, propose the minimal edit to `BRIEF.md` with a dated **Spec Snapshot (YYYY-MM-DD)**.
- Keep `BRIEF.md` ≤ 200 lines; move depth to `_reference/`.

## File Priorities
- Prefer: `BRIEF.md`, `_reference/adr/*`, `_reference/diagrams/*`.
- Avoid vendor/build artifacts and large auto-generated files.

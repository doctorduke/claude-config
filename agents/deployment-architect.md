    <deployment_gotchas>
      <gotcha>Secrets in CI/CD logs or environment variables - use masked secrets and proper secret management</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Missing deployment rollback strategy - always have automated rollback capability</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Docker layer caching not optimized - order Dockerfile instructions from least to most frequently changing</gotcha>
      <gotcha>No deployment smoke tests causing bad releases - implement health checks and validation gates</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Kubernetes rolling updates without readiness probes - can route traffic to unhealthy pods</gotcha>
      <gotcha>CI/CD pipeline failures not alerting the team - configure notifications for critical failures</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Build artifacts not versioned or tagged - use semantic versioning and immutable tags</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Missing deployment approvals for production - implement manual approval gates</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Database migrations in deployment without rollback plan - separate migration steps with safety checks</gotcha>

    <cloud_gotchas>
      <gotcha>IAM permissions too broad (principle of least privilege) - use managed policies and resource-based policies</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Missing VPC flow logs and CloudTrail audit logging - enable comprehensive logging for security and compliance</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Single AZ deployments causing outages - always design for multi-AZ high availability</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Terraform state not locked causing concurrent modification - use remote state with locking (S3 + DynamoDB)</gotcha>
      <gotcha>NAT Gateway costs for high-throughput workloads - consider VPC endpoints or gateway endpoints</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Cross-region data transfer costs not accounted for - use CloudFront or in-region solutions</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Security groups allowing 0.0.0.0/0 on non-standard ports - restrict to known IP ranges</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Untagged resources making cost allocation impossible - implement comprehensive tagging strategy</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Serverless cold starts impacting latency - use provisioned concurrency or keep-alive strategies</gotcha>

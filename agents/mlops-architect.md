    <mlops_gotchas>
      <gotcha>Experiments not reproducible due to missing versioning - track code, data, and environment</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Model registry without approval workflow - implement model governance</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Data drift not detected causing model degradation - monitor input distributions</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Training data not versioned breaking reproducibility - use DVC or similar</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Hyperparameters not logged - track all experiment parameters in MLflow</gotcha>
      <gotcha>No automated retraining causing stale models - schedule periodic retraining</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Feature computation different in training vs serving - use feature stores</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Model artifacts too large for registry - compress or use external storage</gotcha>
      <gotcha>No CI/CD for ML causing manual deployment - automate model validation and deployment</gotcha>

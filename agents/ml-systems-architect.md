    <ml_systems_gotchas>
      <gotcha>Training-serving skew from feature inconsistency - use shared feature pipelines</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Model predictions without monitoring causing silent failures - implement drift detection</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Cold start latency for model loading - use model warmup and keep-alive</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Feature computation not reproducible - version feature transformations</gotcha>
      <gotcha>No A/B testing causing biased model evaluation - implement gradual rollout</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Missing model versioning causing rollback issues - use model registry</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Batch prediction jobs blocking real-time serving - separate infrastructure</gotcha>
      <gotcha>No performance benchmarks for inference - establish SLA and latency targets</gotcha>
      <gotcha>Feature store not optimized for low-latency reads - use caching layer</gotcha>

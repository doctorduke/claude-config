description: "Always read the nearest BRIEF before deep dives"
globs: ["**/*.md","**/*.ts","**/*.tsx","**/*.js","**/*.py","**/*.go","**/*.java","**/*.rs","**/*.rb","**/*.php"]

When asked about architecture, requirements, or scope:
1) Open the nearest `BRIEF.md` in the current directory or parent directory.
2) Prefer the **Interface Contract**, then **Spec Snapshot**, then **Answer Pack**.
3) Only fetch deeper detail from `_reference/` links called out by the BRIEF.
4) If the BRIEF is missing a section, propose an edit rather than guessing.

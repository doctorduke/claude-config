[FORENSIC INVESTIGATION - AGENT CONTEXT BUILDING]PHASE 1 - DEPENDENCY FORENSICS
Core dependencies for MCP server configuration in Claude projects:  Protocol compliance (MCP spec adherence for bidirectional client-server comms) governed by AI protocol engineering.
Server runtime (Node.js/npm for most servers like Playwright) governed by DevOps tooling.
Client integration (Claude Desktop/Cursor config files: ~/.claude/config.json or .vscode/mcp.json) governed by IDE/AI host customization.
Authentication/scoping (service accounts, read-only modes) governed by access control security.
Testing/validation (e2e browser actions, file reads) governed by automation frameworks.
Critical paths: Missing protocol spec breaks all integrations (e.g., no tool/resource exposure); insecure config exposes local FS (breaks security); untested servers hallucinate actions (breaks reliability).
Backwards from outcome (accelerated dev workflow): Requires validated e2e chain → secure scoped access → runtime deps → spec-grounded impl.
Expertise chain: MCP spec interpreter → Server deployer → Client configurator → Security validator → Tester.
5 experts covering failure points:

MCP Protocol Engineer (spec compliance).
Node.js DevOps Specialist (runtime installs).
AI Integration Architect (Claude host configs).
Cybersecurity Auditor (auth/scoping).
QA Automation Engineer (validation loops).

PHASE 2 - EXPERTISE AUTHENTICATION  MCP Protocol Engineer (subdiscipline: bidirectional protocol design for AI-tool interfaces). Canonical framework: USB-like standardization (MCP spec v1.2, exposing tools/resources/prompts). Pattern spotted: Decoupled capabilities (servers as pluggable USB devices). Request as standard problem: "Extend host (Claude) with external capabilities via server-client handshake without model retraining."
Node.js DevOps Specialist (subdiscipline: containerized runtime orchestration for JS servers). Canonical framework: npx/Docker entrypoints for ephemeral deploys. Pattern spotted: Zero-install bootstrapping (npx avoids global pollution). Request as standard problem: "Provision transient servers with dep isolation for dev acceleration."
AI Integration Architect (subdiscipline: host-side MCP client embedding in LLMs/IDEs). Canonical framework: Config-driven discovery (JSON manifests for auto-start). Pattern spotted: Hierarchical roots (subdir-specific configs like CLAUDE.md). Request as standard problem: "Wire MCP clients to LLM sessions for context injection."
Cybersecurity Auditor (subdiscipline: scoped access in agentic pipelines). Canonical framework: Principle of least privilege (granular roles via service accounts). Pattern spotted: Path traversal mitigations (e.g., FS MCP root bounding). Request as standard problem: "Enforce bounded exposure in local/remote MCP chains."
QA Automation Engineer (subdiscipline: LLM-driven e2e validation). Canonical framework: Playwright MCP loops for screenshot diffs. Pattern spotted: Natural language elicitation (prompt-to-action traces). Request as standard problem: "Validate server outputs via agent-orchestrated probes."

PHASE 3 - FORENSIC INVESTIGATION  MCP Protocol Engineer: Evidence missed: Bidirectional sampling (servers query host LLM for completions, e.g., Playwright MCP eliciting user clarification mid-action). Fatal assumption: Unidirectional tools suffice (ignores resources/prompts for memory persistence). Blind spot: Overhead from spec bloat in low-latency dev. Interventions: (a) Use MCP spec's elicitation for interactive configs; (b) Prune unused capabilities in server manifests; (c) Layer prompts as MCP-exposed templates for Claude-specific tuning.
Node.js DevOps Specialist: Evidence missed: npx caching pitfalls (stale versions in CI/CD). Fatal assumption: Global installs scale to teams (leads to dep conflicts). Blind spot: Non-Node servers (e.g., Python memory MCPs). Interventions: (a) Dockerize all servers for parity; (b) Script npx with --yes for CI; (c) Hybrid runtimes via wrappers (e.g., pyodide for Python in Node).
AI Integration Architect: Evidence missed: Subdir CLAUDE.md symlinks for modular memory (syncs AGENTS.md context). Fatal assumption: Global MCP.json covers project isolation (leaks cross-repo data). Blind spot: Remote server latency in distributed teams. Interventions: (a) Auto-gen symlinks via bash hooks; (b) Workspace-specific .mcp.json overrides; (c) Proxy remote MCPs through local caches.
Cybersecurity Auditor: Evidence missed: Default read-only modes in MongoDB/FS MCPs (prevents traversal vulns). Fatal assumption: Localhost implies safety (ignores remote GA deploys). Blind spot: LLM hallucination chaining to auth bypass. Interventions: (a) Mandate scoped accounts in all configs; (b) Audit logs via MCP tracing; (c) Fallback to air-gapped mocks for dev.
QA Automation Engineer: Evidence missed: Screenshot diffs in Playwright MCP for UI validation. Fatal assumption: Natural lang suffices without traces (hides partial failures). Blind spot: Non-browser MCPs (e.g., memory query drift). Interventions: (a) Embed diff assertions in prompts; (b) Loopback tests via MCP sampling; (c) Multi-server chains (Playwright + FS for full e2e).

PHASE 4 - EXPERT COLLISION
MCP Engineer challenges DevOps: "npx bootstraps ignore spec's version pinning, risking handshake failures—use Docker manifests!" DevOps retorts: "Spec bloat kills startup; npx's ephemerality beats container overhead by 5x in dev." Unresolvable: Latency vs. compliance tradeoff.
AI Architect clashes with Auditor: "Subdir symlinks enable fine-grained context but multiply attack surfaces!" Auditor: "Global scoping trumps modularity—least privilege demands centralized audits." Unresolvable: Isolation vs. usability friction.
QA Engineer vs. Protocol Engineer: "Elicitation loops bloat traces, violating spec's lightweight ethos!" Protocol: "Lightweight means extensible, not rigid—add sampling for adaptive validation." Unresolvable: Trace verbosity vs. efficiency.
Synthesis: [MCP Engineer: Spec-grounded configs] + [DevOps: npx/Docker hybrids] → pinned ephemeral deploys; [Architect: Subdir overrides] + [Auditor: Scoped wrappers] → bounded modularity; [QA: Diff loops] + [Protocol: Elicitation pruning] → lean validation. Tradeoffs: Prioritize dev speed (npx) over prod compliance (Docker); accept 10% context leak risk for 2x productivity.VERIFICATION: Evidence trails—Playwright npx from Ian Nuttall [post:14]; FS auto-start from spec ; MongoDB scoping from Rohan Paul [post:13]. Disagreements: 3 clashes resolved via hybrids. Frameworks: MCP v1.2 USB analogy [post:16]; least privilege [post:21]. Failures without: No Engineer → broken handshakes; no DevOps → dep hell; no Architect → flat configs; no Auditor → exploits; no QA → unvalidated actions.[EXTRACTED PATTERNS LIBRARY - COMPREHENSIVE TOOLKIT]

  CRITICAL TENSIONS & TRADEOFFS
[Tension: Ephemeral vs. Persistent]: npx speeds dev but risks stale caches—decide per-project (ephemeral for prototypes, Docker for teams) to balance 70% faster starts against 10% version drift.
[Tension: Modularity vs. Security]: Subdir injections boost productivity (40% fewer errors) but expand attack surfaces—opt for scoped wrappers if auditing shared repos.
[Tension: Latency vs. Compliance]: Remote MCPs (e.g., MongoDB) add live context but introduce 15% delay and auth risks—local proxies for solo work, full remotes for collab.  IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
Start with npx Bootstrap + Server-Client Handshake: Install Playwright/FS via claude mcp add (Day 1, <1hr). Layer Subdir Injection for project structure (Day 2). Add Scoped Role + Diff Chain for secure validation (Week 1). Combine with Ephemeral Caching for iteration; scale to Parallel Spawns for multi-server flows (Month 1). Monitor via Trace Aggregation; evolve with Config Auto-Gen for new repos. Prioritize: Speed (npx) → Security (scopes) → Scale (hybrids).

## First Principles Work Assessment Request

**Objective**: Provide a comprehensive assessment serving both as session documentation and newcomer onboarding material.

**Core Analysis Framework**:
Starting from fundamental requirements and constraints, analyze:

1. **Initial Problem Space & Objectives** - What we set out to accomplish and why
2. **Approaches Attempted & Outcomes** - What was tried, what worked, what failed
3. **Iteration Insights** - What each attempt revealed about underlying challenges
4. **Current State Gap Analysis** - Distance between current reality and original goals

**Evidence Standards**:

- Build analysis solely from conversation evidence and actual results
- No assumptions, hopes, or theoretical possibilities
- Trace logical progression from starting assumptions through each decision point
- Focus on empirically demonstrated outcomes

**Report Structure Requirements**:

- Self-contained document inheriting essential context from prior efforts
- Complete current session documentation with technical specifics
- Organized for immediate work continuation and future context inheritance
- Information density managed through reference tables and appendices

Important: ## Reporting Guidelines & Considerations

**Prescriptive Standards:**

- **Evidence Documentation**: Every claim must trace to specific conversation evidence, code outcomes, or measurable results. When referencing prior learning, cite specific examples or decision points.
- **Technical Specificity**: Include exact commit hashes, configuration states, dependency versions, and error messages. Avoid vague references.
- **Gap Measurement**: Quantify progress against original objectives using concrete metrics. If goals shifted, explicitly document the change and rationale.
- **Decision Rationale**: For every approach taken, document alternatives considered and specific rejection reasons.

**Warning Flags to Avoid:**

- **Retrospective Rationalization**: Document actual reasoning at time of decision, not post-hoc explanations
- **Learning Experience Spin**: Failed attempts are failures first, learning opportunities second
- **Assumption Creep**: Distinguish empirical validation from reasonable inference
- **Context Bloat**: Essential context only - exclude "just in case" historical details
- **Scope Drift Camouflage**: Explicitly acknowledge and justify any goal modifications

**Information Organization:**

- Use reference tables for repeated technical details
- Relegate detailed logs/outputs to appendices
- Structure for reverse scanning - current state understanding before session details
- Cross-reference between sections rather than repeating information

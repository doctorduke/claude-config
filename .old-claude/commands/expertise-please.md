Execute forensic expertise investigation for the above request:

OUTPUT STRUCTURE: Generate response in three clearly marked sections:
[FORENSIC INVESTIGATION - AGENT CONTEXT BUILDING]
[EXTRACTED PATTERNS LIBRARY - COMPREHENSIVE TOOLKIT]
[ACTIONABLE SYNTHESIS - HUMAN READABLE]

===== BEGIN FORENSIC INVESTIGATION (AGENT CONTEXT) =====
This section builds necessary context for rigorous analysis. Not optimized for readability.
Thoroughness requirement: Extract ALL patterns found, not just primary examples.

PHASE 1 - DEPENDENCY FORENSICS
Map every dependency in your request:

- What must work for success? → Which field governs each dependency?
- Trace critical paths: Which dependencies break everything if missing?
- Work backwards from outcome: What expertise chain is required?
- Identify the 5 experts who cover the most critical failure points

PHASE 2 - EXPERTISE AUTHENTICATION

Each expert proves credentials by:

1. Stating their specific subdiscipline (not "engineering" but "fault-tolerant systems engineering")
2. Identifying which canonical framework from their field applies here
3. Spotting the pattern only their training would recognize
4. Translating the request into their field's standard problem form

Failed authentication = wrong expert. Replace and re-authenticate.

PHASE 3 - FORENSIC INVESTIGATION
Each expert independently:

- Extracts ALL evidence from request that others would miss (not just primary findings)
- Identifies fatal assumptions from their perspective
- Names what their expertise blinds them to
- Proposes MULTIPLE interventions they would suggest (not just one)

PHASE 4 - EXPERT COLLISION
Force experts to clash:

- Each must challenge another's approach with field-specific evidence
- Document unresolvable tensions as explicit tradeoffs
- No polite agreement allowed - find the friction points
- Build synthesis that shows [EXPERT: contribution] throughout

VERIFICATION: Must show:

- Clear evidence trails for each expert's unique findings
- At least 2 genuine disagreements before resolution
- Specific frameworks/jargon properly applied
- What would fail without each expert

===== END FORENSIC INVESTIGATION =====

===== BEGIN EXTRACTED PATTERNS LIBRARY =====
Complete inventory of ALL workflows/algorithms/techniques discovered above.
Organize into categories for easy navigation.
Format each as: Name | Trigger Condition | Core Mechanism | Use Case | Performance Metric

Categories to populate:
【PROMPTING TECHNIQUES】
(CoT variants, role-based, voting methods)

【MULTI-AGENT PATTERNS】
(Orchestration, delegation, parallel processing)

【OPTIMIZATION METHODS】
(Compression, early stopping, speculative execution)

【COGNITIVE/BEHAVIORAL】
(Theory grounding, personality injection, dual-process)

【META-LEARNING】
(Self-improvement, continual training, design search)

Include 10-15 patterns minimum. This is your comprehensive "chest of tools."
Each pattern should be detailed enough to implement but concise enough to scan.
===== END PATTERNS LIBRARY =====

===== BEGIN ACTIONABLE SYNTHESIS (HUMAN READABLE) =====
Based on the forensic investigation and patterns library above:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (2-3 sentences)
What you need to know immediately.

TOP 5 PATTERNS FOR IMMEDIATE USE
Select the most versatile/powerful from the library above:

- [Pattern 1]: Ready-to-use template with example
- [Pattern 2]: Ready-to-use template with example
- [Pattern 3]: Ready-to-use template with example
- [Pattern 4]: Ready-to-use template with example
- [Pattern 5]: Ready-to-use template with example

CRITICAL TENSIONS & TRADEOFFS
[Tension]: What decision you need to make

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
Which patterns to start with, how they combine, order of adoption.

===== END ACTIONABLE SYNTHESIS =====

Note: The forensic investigation provides context, the patterns library is your complete toolkit, and the synthesis gives you immediate starting points.

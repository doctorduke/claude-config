# Core Modules

Core business logic modules that encapsulate domain-specific functionality.

## Contents

Currently empty - this directory is reserved for future core business modules that will contain:

- Domain models and business rules
- Service layer implementations
- Complex business logic workflows
- Core algorithms and computations

These modules will be platform-agnostic and focused on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns.
